Design files for a pogo pin fixture allowing mirrored or normal ICSP connections, and providing both 6 pin and 10 pin programming cable connections.

The design was created in pcb-rnd, the open source PCB editor ( repo.hu/projects/pcb-rnd )

The design is licenced under the TAPR open hardware licence.

The design assumes 1.3mm diameter pogo pins are being used. Spacers are required between a pair of the boards.

After soldering the dual inline socket or sockets onto the upper board, the spacers can be used to create the parallel stack up, at which point the pogo pins can be soldered into the normal or inverted footprint, taking care to ensure they are soldered into position with the same vertical position relative to the PCB surface(s).

The zipped gerber files were used with seeed studio to produce the boards shown. The gerbers should be compatible with most PCB manufacturer requirements.
